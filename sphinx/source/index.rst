EcanAlloUsageTools - tools for extracting and integrating ECan allocation and usage data
============================================================================================
This package contains a core class (AlloUsage) that provides a variety of methods to extract and combine allocation and usage data.
It is primarily designed to return the allocation and usage data as a time series over a period of time in the past.

At the moment, these tools are only usable from within the ECan network. A future installment will optionally utilize external facing web service calls once they have been established.

The GitHub repository is found `here <https://github.com/mullenkamp/EcanAlloUsageTools>`_.
Feedback and contributions are welcome.
